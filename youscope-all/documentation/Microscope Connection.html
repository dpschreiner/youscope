				    <h1><a name="MicroscopeConnection-MicroscopeConnection"></a>Microscope Connection</h1>

<p>To connect to the microscope, YouScope uses&nbsp;parts of the functionality&nbsp;provided by the open source project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.micro-manager.org">Micro-Manager</a>. Micro-Manager is a microscope control software similar to YouScope, but with a different scope.&nbsp;Compared to YouScope, it&nbsp;might be described as a lower-level, which in this context means that one can control the microscope more direct. Similar to YouScope, Micro-Manager is split up into a server (mainly providing the functionality) and a client (mainly providing&nbsp;the user interface). The server part of Micro-Manager can be described as a large set of drivers for different microscope devices, and a small layer of interfaces allowing any client application to choose, load&nbsp;and control the drivers for the hardware the microscope consists of. YouScope uses these interfaces of the Micro-Manager server to connect to the microscope, but has no relation to the Micor-Manager client. Thus, YouScope profits from the large amount of drivers already available for Micro-Manager, and it is easily possible to switch between the Micro-Manager client and YouScope without the need to do the configuration of the microscope twice.</p>

<p>When the YouScope server is started, it is loading the Micro-Manager server in its process. In a first step, it is then hiding all interfaces of Micro-Manager by its own, more abstract interfaces. The main modules of the YouScope server, all plugins and the clients connected to the YouScope server can only access the microscope using this additional layer of interfaces, but do not have access to the lower level layer provided by Micro-Manager.</p>
