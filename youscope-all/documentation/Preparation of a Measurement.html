<h2><a name="PreparationofaMeasurement-CoarseParameterSettings%28LiveStream%29"></a>Coarse Parameter Settings (LiveStream)</h2>


<p>Before starting a measurement, the position of the cells have to be found, the focus has to be adjusted and the optimal exposure time for bright field or fluorescent imaging has to be determined. For this purpose a&nbsp;<em>LiveSteam</em>&nbsp;mode can be used. The LiveStream can be found in&nbsp;<b>Tools-&gt;YouScope LiveStream</b>.&nbsp;To increase the visibility of the cells in a rather dark image exposure time can be adjusted, or the option&nbsp;<em>Increase Contrast</em>&nbsp;can be selected. The latter makes it easier to localize the cells, to adjust the focus and to get an impression about the viability of the cells and their fluorescence properties.&nbsp;The LiveStream is used in the following way: First, the microplate is moved within the xy-plane in a position, where the beam illuminates the sample. Second, the focus is adjusted by moving the microplate along the z-axis, if the microscope has a hardware focus system. Finally the autofocus on the microscope is switched on and its offset is corrected. Then the option Increase Contrast is deselected to determine a good exposure time: The exposure time is increased or decreased until the cells are clearly visible in the live stream. The determination of a good exposure time is further described by the histogram, which should have its maximum in the middle.</p>

<p><font color="#333333"><em>Channel group</em></font><font color="#333333">: In each channel group different channels are grouped in sets for more clarity. The groups are defined in the configuration file loaded at the startup of YouScope. For example, the different colors of the emitted wavelengths for red-, blue-, green&#45; and yellow-fluorescent proteins, or the bright field light could form a group.&nbsp;</font><font color="#333333">Another group could contain the same channels with different values for the binning of the camera</font><font color="#333333">.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font color="#333333"><em>Channel</em></font><font color="#333333">: Depending on the selection of the</font> <font color="#333333"><em>Channel Group,</em></font> <font color="#333333">one</font> <font color="#333333"><em>Channel</em></font> <font color="#333333">from this group can be chosen, representing e.g. the filter settings for imaging the wavelengths of&nbsp;red-, blue-, green-, yellow light.</font></p>

<p><em>Imaging Period</em>: In the <em>LiveStream</em> the image is refreshed in a defined time interval. This is done automatically and there is no need to refresh it manually. The size of interval can be defined in <em>Imaging Period</em>. By default it is set to 100 ms. However, the real period highly depends on the hardware, as well as on the chosen exposure time. Thus, the given value rather corresponds to the minimal refresh-period.</p>

<p><em>Contrast and Histogram</em>: The histogram of the intensity distribution is helpful for the determination of a good exposure time as described below in the section <em>Exposure</em>. The option <em>Increase Contrast</em> optimizes the&nbsp;contrast between the cells and the background in the image. This option is activated for the adjustment of the focus or the localization of the cells in the well.&nbsp;The option <em>Auto-Adjust&nbsp;</em><em>Contrast</em>&nbsp;will adjust the upper and lower clipping boarders, based on the pixel with the highest and lowest intensity in the range. If <em>Auto Adjust Contrast</em> is activated, the boarders cannot be manually adjusted by the user.</p>

<p><em>Exposure</em>: To illuminate the imaging area properly, the exposure time has to be determined for each channel. After a position containing cells is found and the focus is adjusted, the exposure time has to be determined. The option&nbsp;<em>Increase Contrast</em> has to be deselected first. Then the exposure time has to be increased till the cells start being visible in the live stream and the histogram fills the area maximal.&nbsp;</p>
