<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>YouScope R2016 Beta 6 is now available. Most of the changes in this version consider the support of non-rectangular microplates. Since a lot of the code base considering microplate measurements had to be changed, this version might not be as stable as the other beta releases. Choose Beta 5 or a later version if stability is most important for you.<br />

<ul>
    <li>Support of custom, non-rectangular microplates. The microplates can have virtually any layout, including gaps, missing wells, different well sizes, and unregular positions.</li>
    <li>Path optimizers were revisited: there are a few more options in the different optimizers, e.g. different metrics.</li>
    <li>Complete refactoring of the microplate measurement: Position configuration should be significantly simpler, and configured positions can manually be changed afterwards.</li>
