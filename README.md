YouScope Microscope Control Software

YouScope is a free, open-source microscope control software compatible with most present-day automized microscopes. YouScope allows to easily automatize complex microscopy protocols using an user-friendly graphical interface. Besides a wide range of built-in configurable standard protocols, like the measurement of the wells of various types of microplates with brightfield, fluorescence and out-of-focus channels, it is easily extendable to support specific custom protocols. For this task, various scripting languages, like JavaScript and Matlab, are supported, as well as lower level plugins written in Java.
