YouScope is a free, open-source microscope control software compatible with most present-day automized microscopes. YouScope allows to easily automatize complex microscopy protocols using an user-friendly graphical interface. Besides a wide range of built-in configurable standard protocols, like the measurement of the wells of various types of microplates with brightfield, fluorescence and out-of-focus channels, it is easily extendable to support specific custom protocols. For this task, various scripting languages, like JavaScript and Matlab, are supported, as well as lower level plugins written in Java.</p>

<p>To utilize the capabilities of YouScope in your company or institution, read more about YouScope in our Documentation and download YouScope for various operating systems in our Download Area.
Microplate Measurements</p>

<p><img src="http://www.youscope.org/images/flowchartMicroplate.jpg" alt="Microplate Measurement">
One of the main functionalities of YouScope is to automatize complex measurement procedures for different kinds of microplates. The experimentalist only has to choose the wells to measure and the imaging procedures to be carried out for every of these wells (see Figure 2). Furthermore, one can choose how long to stay in one well, how often and how fast to iterate through all wells, and many more.</p>

<p>Several typicall imaging tasks are already pre-defined and easy to configure, including bright field and fluorescence imaging, out-of-focus imaging, composed imaging, and the variation device settings. If more specific imaging procedures should be carried out, YouScope is easily extendable, either by using a scripting interface (JavaScript or Matlab) or by a lower level Java interface.</p>
